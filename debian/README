The Debian Package grml-rescueboot
----------------------------------

Usually systems are rescued with CD or usb stick. grml-rescueboot makes
it possible to simply copy an ISO image onto harddisk and boot the
rescue image. This eliminates the need to carry around a usb stick
to rescue a system.
grml-rescueboot includes the script 42_grml which is installed in
/etc/grub.d and run when update-grub is executed. The script looks for
ISO images in /boot/grml/ and adds an entry for each image found.

Howto:
------

- Get a recent grml image from http://grml.org/download/
- Copy the image to /boot/grml
- Run update-grub
- Reboot and enjoy your new rescue system

Limitations:
------------

grml-rescueboot uses the loopback feature of grub2, so it won't work
with legacy grub. Furthermore the ISO image needs to support
loopback.cfg, a file which is placed in /boot/grub/. Grml supports
loopback.cfg beginning with version 2010.04.
